Performed Bottom up approach and Implemented Interface 

### Bottom up Approach
It is the type in which the task is divided into small part. bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system.
Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception.


#### Comparision between  ## Bottom up approach Vs ## Procedure approach

##### Bottom up approach

* It is divided into small part called object.
* It can easily use access specifier.
* It Provide the Feature Data hidding
* Overloading is possible.


##### Common example of bottom approcah are: 
       C | FORTRAN | Basic

##### Procedure approach

* It is divided into small part called function.
* No access specifier.
* It donot Provide the Feature Data hidding
* Overloading is not possible.

##### Common example of bottom approcah are: 
       Java | c++ | Python | C#
