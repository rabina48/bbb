package Interface;
            //looks like a class but it is not a class
//  can have methods and variables just like the class
//  but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract
// Use for full abstraction
//an interface can not implement another interface. It has to extend the other interface.
//class needs to implement them before they access it.
